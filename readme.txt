The easiest way to post to your WordPress blog by email.

== Description ==

The easiest way to post to your WordPress blog using email.  Just activate the plugin and you'll get an email address to send to which will post the contents directly to your blog.
The subject of the email is the title of the post and the body of the email will be the contents of the post.  Posts will be published immediately after sending the email. Post by email!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `postviaemail.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

OR

Just grab it from the built in plugin directory and choose "Install now", hit ok, then select the "Activate Plugin" link.

== Screenshots ==

1. After the plugin is activated you'll see a screen similar to this.  The email address given is the one you'll use to post to your site.  Just copy this email address and start sending email to post directly to your WordPress blog.
2. If you forget your postviaemail.com email address, or want to change it, just click the "Writing" menu item under "Settings" in your WordPress admin panel and under "Post via e-mail" will be a small section with your email address and a link to change it.
